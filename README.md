# Warren's Recipes

Warren's Recipes is a website I've created as a place for people who are looking for recipes of delicious foods to come and explore.

I've only added a few of my favourite recipes so far but I want it to be a place where I as both a chef and a website designer can record my progress and development and perhaps help people and myself develop their culinary skills and techniques.

## Features 

### Existing Features

- __Navigation Bar__

  - Featured on all three pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Home page, recipes for the starters, mains and desserts and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
  - This section will allow the user to easily navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the previous page via the ‘back’ button.

   This section will be updated in the future with new and exciting recipes.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub) 

- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
  - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
