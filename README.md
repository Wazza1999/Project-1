# Warren's Recipes

Warren's Recipes is a website I've created as a place for people who are looking for recipes of delicious foods to come together and explore.

I've only added a few of my favourite recipes so far but I want it to be a place where I as both a chef and a website designer can record my progress and development and perhaps help other people develop their culinary skills and techniques.

  - The footer section includes links to the relevant social media sites for Warren's kitchen. The links will open to a new tab to allow easy navigation for the user.
